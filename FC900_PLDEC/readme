PL Decoder for the FC-900
This is an interposer that installs at the IC location for the MC-315 PL encoder chip on the FC-900 PCB.
Three jumper wires must be installed on the FC-900:
1) U3-5 connects to U3-8 (this duplicates UF-7 and isolates the decoder connection from the external connector)
2) U5-9 connects to U3-11 (duplicate UF-7)
3) U5-10 connects to U1-5 (SQSA)
4) U5-12 connects to R22/C18 (DETA)
The operator enables the PL decoder by setting "UF-7" to be open.  Setting UF-7 to "closed/GND" disables the decode option
allowing the FC-900 to function normally with carrier squelch.
